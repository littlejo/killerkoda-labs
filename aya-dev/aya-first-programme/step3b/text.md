Now you have to improve the code to log which commands are executed.

<br>

There are two important programs in eBPF:
* kernel space program: `aya-test-ebpf/src/main.rs`
* user space program: `aya-test/src/main.rs`

For this tutorial, you only need to modify **kernel space program**.

To edit the code, you need a text editor. You can use the **Editor** tab:
* Select the `aya-test` directory
* Navigate to `aya-test-ebpf/src/main.rs`
