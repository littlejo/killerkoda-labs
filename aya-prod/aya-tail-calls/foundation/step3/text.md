Now, you're working in user space (`tracepoint-binary/src/main.rs`).

Your goal is to:

âœ… Retrieve the eBPF map that you just created on the kernel side.

âœ… Attach the eBPF programs in user space.

âœ… Fill the eBPF map with these programs to enable tail calls.


### Retrieve the eBPF map

Add the following code before `let ctrl_c = signal::ctrl_c();`:

```rust
let map = ebpf.take_map("JUMP_TABLE").unwrap();
let mut tail_call_map = ProgramArray::try_from(map)?;
```{{copy}}

Also, **import the required library**:

```rust
use aya::maps::ProgramArray;
```{{copy}}

### Attach the eBPF programs and fill the map

Insert this snippet:

```rust
let prg_list = ["tracepoint_binary_filter", "tracepoint_binary_display"];

for (i, prg) in prg_list.iter().enumerate() {
    {
        let program: &mut TracePoint = ebpf.program_mut(prg).unwrap().try_into()?;
        program.load()?;
        let fd = program.fd().unwrap();
        tail_call_map.set(i as u32, fd, 0)?;
    }
}
```{{copy}}

### Compile and run the code


* Ensure your code compiles successfully:
```plain
cd /host/root/project
cargo run
```{{exec interrupt}}

Now that the foundation for tail calls is in place, you need to refine the eBPF programs to make them fully functional.

ðŸ”¹ Enable dynamic interaction between eBPF programs using tail calls
You'll modify the programs so they can chain execution dynamically through the JUMP_TABLE map.
ðŸ”¹ Define a specific purpose for each eBPF program

Each program (filter and display) should have a clear, distinct role:
* filter: Apply filtering logic before processing events.
* display: Log or analyze relevant information after filtering.

By implementing these changes, your eBPF programs will collaborate efficiently, optimizing performance and flexibility. ðŸš€
